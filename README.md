# Game-FromBook-Js
A game from an old book on BBC BASIC, converted to JS

In conversation, my mother-in-law showed me a book on learning BASIC. I have vague memories of having something similar as a child - 
but it occurred to me that it might be fun to try to create one of the games in a more modern language.

The game was entitled "Haunted House"
